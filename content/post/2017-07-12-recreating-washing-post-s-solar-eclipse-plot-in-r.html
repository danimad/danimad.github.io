<p>I will continue copycatting visualization in this post.<br />
This I seen the following visualization from a couple of difference sources:</p>

<p>I thought this would also be a good vis to recreate. I had a couple of different ideas on how to recreate it, but little did I know how difficult it would be. <em>Disclaimer:</em> I created this purely with geometrically, it doesn’t represent the true path of of an eclipse.</p>

<p>The basics of the visualization seems pretty easy, you creates eclipses with differnt occlusions on a grid. First I thougth it would be difficult to do this properly, so I wanted to use emojis or unicode for it. Alas I couldn’t plot the special characters on the plot, which was ultimatelly fortunate, because the next day I had an idea for a real neat sollution. I plot two point in a grid point, one for the sun, on for the moon, and I offset one by a given number. For this offset I used the distance from the eclipse line, which I calculated below with the function borrowed from [stackoverflow][dist_fun]. I scale this distance to a <span class="math inline">\([0,1]\)</span> range, which I can multiple up later so that it fits with the plotted point’s size.</p>

<p>Two tricks I had to use were the following, first I had to filter the point that are inside of the map, and secondly in the original plot the eclipses “below” the eclipse line deviated in a differnt directiont that those that are “above” it. For this I created two filters. For both I used the <code>inpip</code> function from the <code>splancs</code> package. This filters points by looking if there are inside a polygon or not. First I filtered with the US map polygon, and in the second filter I created a polygon that encompases the area above the line. This was a pretty elegant sollution in the end, because at first I wanted to implement it with a signed distance function.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># lower triangle for point that are &quot;under&quot; the line
upper_poly &lt;- data.table(x = c(long_min, long_min, long_max, long_max),
                         y = c(lat_max, line_left[2], line_right[2], lat_max))

points[inpip(points[,c(&quot;long&quot;, &quot;lat&quot;)], upper_poly),
       dist_scaled := dist_scaled * -1]

# create eclipse line manually
ecl_l &lt;- -124
ecl_r &lt;- -81
ecl_line &lt;- data.table(x = c(ecl_l,
                             ecl_r),
                       y = c(ecl_l * line_slope + line_int,
                             ecl_r * line_slope + line_int))</code></pre>
<p>Finally I plotted the result:</p>
