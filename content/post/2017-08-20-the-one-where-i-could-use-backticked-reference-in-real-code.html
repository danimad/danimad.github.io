<p>I alway liked that in Haskell you can inflix a function with backticks like this:</p>
<pre class="haskell"><code>take 5 [1..]

-- is the same as

5 `take` [1..]</code></pre>
<p>You can do a similar thing in R. In R, when you surround for example an operator, like <code>[]</code>, or <code>+</code>, you can use it like a normal function. This is because these operators are also <a href="https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/ls01_map-name-position-shortcuts.html">function calls</a>.<br />
Until now I couldn’t really use this in real life code, but the other day I had to scrape wikipedia and it was pretty handy.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library(tidyverse)
  library(rvest)
})

# Wiki page for European cities
cities_wiki &lt;- &quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_cities_by_population_within_city_limits&quot;

# rvest function to read html
eu_cities &lt;- read_html(cities_wiki)

# take the table on the site and extract the cities
cities &lt;- eu_cities %&gt;%
  html_nodes(&quot;table&quot;) %&gt;%
  html_table() %&gt;%
  `[[`(2) %&gt;% 
  `$`(City)

head(cities)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Istanbul[a]&quot;      &quot;Moscow[b]&quot;        &quot;London&quot;          
## [4] &quot;Saint Petersburg&quot; &quot;Berlin&quot;           &quot;Madrid&quot;</code></pre>
