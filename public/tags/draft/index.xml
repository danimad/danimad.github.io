      <description>I alway liked that in Haskell you can inflix a function with backticks like this:
take 5 [1..] -- is the same as 5 `take` [1..] You can do a similar thing in R. In R, when you surround for example an operator, like [], or +, you can use it like a normal function. This is because these operators are also function calls.
Until now I couldn’t really use this in real life code, but the other day I had to scrape wikipedia and it was pretty handy.</description>

      <description>Last week I read the leaked phone calls between Donald Trump, and the leaders of Mexico, and Australia, and I was again shocked a bit, by the president’s command of the English language. Coincidently, I wanted to read, and try out the things in the Tidy Textmining in R book, so here we are.
if (!require(&amp;quot;pacman&amp;quot;)) install.packages(&amp;quot;pacman&amp;quot;) pacman::p_load(rprojroot, tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, rvest, stringi, tidytext, knitr) # setting project root, and creating temp folder for images # root &amp;lt;- find_root(is_rstudio_project) For start I downloaded the text for both conversations seperately.</description>

      <description>I will continue copycatting visualization in this post.
This I seen the following visualization from a couple of difference sources:
Oh, this is cool. https://t.co/eCSKI6ag3P pic.twitter.com/BoBlMjZGV7 — Teddy Amenabar (@TeddyAmen) July 10, 2017   I thought this would also be a good vis to recreate. I had a couple of different ideas on how to recreate it, but little did I know how difficult it would be. Disclaimer: I created this purely with geometrically, it doesn’t represent the true path of of an eclipse.</description>
